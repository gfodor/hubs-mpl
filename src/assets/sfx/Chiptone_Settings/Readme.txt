- The sound names are not always a 1-to-1 match with the events they are tied to, but it should be relatively easy to figure out how they're being used in Hubs.

- Generally, we try to export the sounds a 44100Hz, 16bit, and close to Chiptone's full volume. 
- Until we have a 'settings' page in Hubs, individual sound volumes will have to be adjusted to taste.
